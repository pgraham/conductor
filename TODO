- Update session manager to delete expired sessions. This needs to be
  re-evaluated.

- Update clarinet to have classes that implement database specific behaviour for
  supported databases.  Should support MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite

- Update CdtInitDbStep to use a zpt\db\DatabaseConnection object. Encapsulate
  the database updater logic so that it can be used by the CdtInitDbStep and the
  cdt-update script.
