- Update session manager to delete expired sessions.

- Move model parsing and ActorFactory out of clarinet and into a reed package.

- Eliminate static methods from libraries (this will make them easier to test)
  and make the 'singleton' behaviour provided by the static's injectable.  Once
  this is done update Conductor's initialization and affected tests to do the
  injection.

- Update CRUD service retrieve method to support sorting and paging

- Update sql to not use backticks but to use double quotes instead.  This will
  require that MySQL users turn on the ANSI_QUOTES SQL_MODE.
