NOW:
-----
- Update session to have a last access column
- Update session manager to delete expired sessions.


WHENEVER:
----------
- Move source generation capabilities out of clarinet and into a reed package.
  - Have moved TemplateLoader to reed\generator\CodeTemplateLoader, is there
    more?
- Move model parsing and ActorFactory out of clarinet and into a reed package.
- Update reed/Config to allow all configuration to be set.  This will allow
  the conductor configuration parser to control these settings.
    - This will mean that specifying config though overridding will be obsolete
      and so can be removed
- Eliminate static methods from libraries (this will make them easier to test)
  and make the 'singleton' behaviour provided by the static's injectable.  Once
  this is done update Conductor's initialization and affected tests to do the
  injection.
